Here's a nice place to store test formulas. The convert.sh script will take
*.qbf files in boole format from the boole directory and convert them (using
boole2qpro) to .qpro files stored in the qpro directory.

The solve.sh script will run all the files in the qpro directory through qpro
(outputting the results to stdout).

There are already 29 random formulas from the NPNCNF2008 qbflib collection
(http://www.qbflib.org/NPNCNF2008.tar.gz ~500MB) in the boole directory,
although they need to be unzipped before running the convert.sh script, as well
as the corresponding .qpro files in the qpro directory (zipped as well).
