Here's a nice place to store test formulas. The convert.sh script will take
*.qbf files in boole format from the boole directory and convert them (using
boole2qpro) to .qpro files stored in the qpro directory.

The solve.sh script will run all the files in the qpro directory through qpro
(outputting the results to stdout).

The createbatch.sh creates a batch.txt file (output on stdout, so it shoud be
redirected to batch.txt in the parent directory).

There are already some random formulas from the NPNCNF2008 qbflib collection
(http://www.qbflib.org/NPNCNF2008.tar.gz) in the boole directory.
