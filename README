QPar - Distributed QBF-Solving

Description
QPar is a system for the distribution of the computation of quantified boolean 
formulas (qbf) to multiple machines. QPar was initially designed to receive a 
qbf in boole-format and distribute it to remote multicore hosts for 
satisfiability-checking with qpro (http://big.tuwien.ac.at/staff/seidl/qpro/). 
It can however be easily expanded to use other solvers and branching 
heuristics.

Quickstart:
1.	Master Setup
Choose a control-host, which is reachable from all slave-hosts
1.1	Edit a batch-file, like below

-- my_batch_file.txt
waitforslave 2 qpro
newjob PATH_TO_YOUR_QBF PATH_TO_RESULT_SUMMARY qpro {simple|rand|litcount}
startjob 1
waitforresult 1
killallslaves
quit
--

This will tell the master daemon to
- Wait until 2 cores come available which provide the qpro solver
- Create a new job with parameters. You have to choose a heuristic (simple, etc)
- Start the job created above. Ids start at 1, and are incremented by 1
- Wait until we have a result for the job with Id 1
- Shutdown all registered remote slave hosts (the daemons not the machines)
- Shutdown the master daemon

1.2 Start the master daemon
./qpar_master.sh -i=PATH_TO_MY_BATCH_FILE [-log={debug|info}]
Its waiting for the slaves to register now

2. Slave Setup
2.1 Connect to the waiting master
./qpar_slave.sh tcp://MASTERS_IP_ADDRESS:61616 [-log={debugg|info}]

3. Result
The result should be in your specified file, together with some stats

GUI
	The master can be started with the "-gui" option. The gui gives some 
	basic functionality as starting, stopping and creation of jobs. There 
	is also an overview of registered slaves.
	 	
Interactive Shell & Batch files
	Batch files specified by the "-i"- parameter use the same interpreter as the 
	interactive shell. The interactive shell is started by default, if no "-gui" 
	or "-i" parameter was given. Available commands include (case insensitive):
	NEWJOB path_to_formula path_to_outputfile solverid heuristic
	Creates a new job.
	
	STARTJOB
	Starts the job with the specified id.
	
	ABORTJOB jobid
	Aborts the job with the specified id.
	
	VIEWJOBS
	Shows a list of Jobs.
	
	KILLSLAVE hostname
	Kills the slavedaemon on the specified host.
	
	VIEWSLAVES
	Shows a list of registered slaves.
	
	WAITFORSLAVE number_of_cores solverid
	Halts execution until at least the specified number of cores providing the 
	solver are registered.
	
	KILLALLSLAVES
	Kills the slavedaemon on all registered hosts.
	
	HELP
	Show a help message.
	
	QUIT
	Terminates the masterdaemon.
	
	SOURCE path_to_file
	Sources a specified file (batchfile)
	
	WAITFORRESULT jobid
	Pauses execution until a result for the specified job is available
