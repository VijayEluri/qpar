QPar - Distributed QBF-Solving

Description
QPar is a multithreaded distributed solver for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) in negation normal form. QPar works by semantically splitting a formula into sub-problems and distributing them to multiple slave hosts for parallel computation. The splitting method, a variant of the DPLL algorithm, allows for the use of different branching heuristics. Multi-threading on the slave components allow for maximum utilisation of modern multi-core/multi-processor systems.

QPar features a modular architecture, making the implementation of new back ends easy and allowing it to be used as a general parallelization framework for single-threaded solvers. QPar also introduces new branching heuristics for formulas in NNF which have not been discussed in present literature yet.
